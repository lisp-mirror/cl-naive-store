* Introduction

=cl-naive-store= is a log structured document store. Documents are
loaded in-memory to give facilitate fast querying. Depending on how
you use the store documents will be lazy loaded. indexed, and written
completely in Common Lisp.

The "naive" comes from the fact that data is persisted
as plists in files to make them human and machine readable, also there
is no rocket science code.

The store was designed to be customisable, just about anything can be
customised, have a look at the implementation API to get an idea of
what is possible.

** Layered Design

=cl-naive-store= can do a lot but you as the user must decide how much
of the store's functionality you want to use for your own project.

Functionality was broken down into these packages:

- =cl-naive-store.naive-core=
- =cl-naive-store.document-types=
- =cl-naive-store.definitions=
- =cl-naive-store.naive-documents=
- =cl-naive-store.naive-indexed=
- =cl-naive-store.tests=

The following .asd files can be used to load different functionality:

- =cl-naive-store.naive-core.asd= loads the most basic functionality for
  =cl-naive-store=. Use this if you don't any of the other extensions.

- =cl-naive-store.naive-merkle.asd= loads =naive-documents= and the
  /experimental/ merkle functionality.

- =cl-naive-store.naive-indexed.asd= loads =naive-core= and index
  functionality.

- =cl-naive-store.document-types.asd= loads =naive-core= and document-type
  functionality.

- =cl-naive-store.document-defs.asd= loads =naive-core=, document-types
  and type definition functionality.

- =cl-naive-store.documents.asd= loads naive-core, naive-indexed,
  documents-types, definitions and document functionality.

- =cl-naive-store.asd= loads the whole shebang.
