* User API

The classes, accessors and generic functions used by the typical user
of cl-naive-store. Please have a look at the documentation and
examples for help on how to use cl-naive-store. The api documentation
only deals with the specifics of individual api functions. If you want
to cutsomize cl-naive-store then you need to use the functionality
described here in condjuction with the Implementor's Api.

** Naive Core

*** Store

**** [class] universe

Stores are held by a universe to make up a database.

***** [accessor] stores

List of stores contained by this universe.

***** [accessor] store-class

The class that should be used to make stores.

NOTES:

store-class is delcaritively specied here because stores are dynamically
created when definition files are loaded.

***** [accessor] location

Directory path to stores.

-----

**** [class] store

Document types and their associated collections are organized into
groups called stores.

***** [accessor] universe

The universe this store belongs to.

***** [accessor] name

Store name.

***** [accessor] collection-class

The class that should be used to make collections.

***** [accessor] collections

List of collections represented by this store.

***** [accessor] Location

The directory path to the document-type files and collection files for
this store.

-----
**** [class] shard

Sharding is when you break the physical file that backs the collection
into smaller files based on data elements of a document. An instance
of a shard class is used to load the documents belonging to the shard
into memory.

***** [accessor] mac

Mac to identify shard.

***** [accessor] location

The file path to this shard is stored.

***** [accessor] documents

Documents belonging to shard stored in an adjustable array.

***** [accessor] status

Used internally during the loading of the documents in a shard to help with locking.

***** [accessor] lock

Used internally to do shard specific locking.

-----

**** [class] collection

A collection of documents of a specific document-type.

***** [accessor] store

The store that this collection belongs to.

***** [accessor] name

The collection name.

***** [accessor] location

The directory path to where files for this collection are stored.

***** [accessor] shards

A vector of shards.

NOTES:

Originally naive-store used lists but with the re-introduction of
sharding, we chose to also introduce the use of lparrallel to speed
up many functions and lparrallel has a preference for arrays.

***** [accessor] keys

Keys need to be set to handle duplicates, the default is :key if :key
is not found in the document then duplicates will occur.

NOTES:

For collections that use cl-naive-document-type there is a fallback
the document-type is checked for keys as well and the collection's
keys will be set to the keys set in the document-type elements.

***** [accessor] shard-elements

shard-elements is a list of document element keywords to use for sharding.

-----

**** [generic function] short-mac (shard)

Return a short string containing a prefix of the MAC.

**** [function] match-shard (filename shards)

Check filename against a list of shards to find the matching shard.

**** [generic function] get-shard (collection shard-mac &key &allow-other-keys)

Get the shard object by its mac. Shard lookups are done so much that
there is no choice but to cache them in a hashtable, but that
hashtable needs to be thread safe so using safe functions to get and
set.

**** [generic function] make-shard (collection shard-mac))
make-shard ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) shard-mac)

Creates an instance of a shard using the supplied mac.

**** [function] document-shard-mac (collection document)

Calculating a mac is expensive so caching shard value macs in a
hashtable but that hashtable needs to be thread safe so using safe
functions to get and set.

**** [generic function] get-store (universe store-name)

Returns a store if found in the universe.

**** [generic function] get-collection (store collection-name)

Returns a collection document if found in the store.

**** [generic function] persist (object &key &allow-other-keys)

persist ((store store) &key &allow-other-keys)

Persists a store definition and not what it contains! Path to file is
of this general format /universe/store-name/store-name.store.

persist ((collection collection) &key &allow-other-keys)

Persists a collection definition and the documents in a
collection. Path to file for data is this general format
/universe/store-name/collection-name/collection-name.log

**** [function] persist-collection (collection)

Persists the documents in a collection in the order that they where
added.

**** [generic function] add-store (universe store)

add-store ((universe universe) (store store))

**** [generic function] add-collection (store collection)

add-collection ((store store) (collection collection))

Adds a collection to a store.

**** [generic function] clear-collection (collection)

Clears documents indexes etc from collection.

**** [generic function] remove-collection (store collection)

Removes a collection to a store.

**** [generic function] load-data (collection &key force-reload-p &allow-other-keys)

Loads the data documents of a collection from file or files if
sharding is used. If the data is already loaded it wont reload it, if
you want the data to be reloaded use force-reload-p.

shard-macs is a list of shard macs to indicate which shards should be
used. If no shards are specified all shards will be loaded.

NOTES:

load-data could have been used to load universe or store as well but
those have a wealth of other key word parameters to control exactly
what to do that makes the load-data signature a nightmare to
understand. So separate methods load-stores (for universe) and
load-collections (for a store) exists for that.

load-data :around ((collection collection) &key force-reload-p &allow-other-keys)
load-data ((collection collection) &key &allow-other-keys)

Explicitly stops execution of main methods if already loaded, unless forced.

**** [generic function] data-loaded-p (container &key *allow-other-keys)

data-loaded-p ((collection collection) &key &allow-other-keys)

data-loaded-p ((collection collection) &key &allow-other-keys)

data-loaded-p ((universe universe) &key &allow-other-keys)

Checks if the data is loaded for the container, be it universe , store or collection.

NOTES:

This physically checks each collection's underlying concrete data structure for data. This is done because a collection can be empty and still loaded, thus setting a status when loaded became confusing and could be missed by an over loading method.

If you change the underlying container for (shards collection) or the
container for (docutments shard) you have to implement
data-loaded-p. Your implementation is expected to physically check for
document count > 0 and not some status set. Be smart about it you are
not expected to return a count so dont waist time counting just check
if there is at least one document in the container.

-----
*** Load

**** [generic function] load-collections (store  &key with-data-p &allow-other-keys)

load-collections ((store store) &key with-data-p &allow-other-keys)

Finds and loads collections of a store, with or without documents.

**** [generic function] load-stores (universe  &key with-collections-p with-data-p &allow-other-keys)

Finds and loads collections a store, with or without data documents.

**** [generic function] load-store (store &key &allow-other-keys)

load-store ((store store) &key with-data-p &allow-other-keys)

Loads the document-types and collections, with or without the actual
data documents.

-----

*** Documents

**** [generic function] document-values (document)

Returns a plist of document values.

NOTES:

Exists to ease the compatibility of various implementation
functions. Basically it blurs the line between plists and more complex
documents like cl-naive-documents document struct.

This helps keep the amount of specializations needed down
considerably.

**** [generic function] key-values (collection values &key &allow-other-keys)

key-values ((collection collection) values &key &allow-other-keys)

Returns a set of key values from the values of a data document. Checks
the collection keys or uses hash.

**** [generic function] existing-document (collection document &key shard &allow-other-keys)

Finds any documents with the same key values. This could return the
exact same document or a similar document.

If a shard is passed in then the search is limited to that shard.

IMPL NOTES:

This is an essential part of loading and persisting documents, take
care when implementing.

**** [generic function] deleted-p (document)

(setf deleted-p) (value document &key &allow-other-keys))

Indicates if a data document has been marked as deleted.

naive-store writes data to file sequentially and when deleting data
documents it does not remove a data document from the underlying file
it just marks it as deleted.

**** [generic function] remove-document (collection document &key shard &allow-other-keys)

remove-document ((collection collection) document &key shard &allow-other-keys)

Removes an document from the collection and its indexes. See add-document.

Supplying a shard saves the function from trying to figure out which
shard to remove the document from.

**** [generic function] delete-document (collection document &key shard &allow-other-keys))

delete-document ((collection collection) document &key shard &allow-other-keys)

Removes a document from the collection, marks the document as deleted
and persists the deleted document to disk.

Supplying a shard saves the function from trying to figure out which
shard to remove the document from.

**** [generic function] add-document (collection document &key shard &allow-other-keys)

add-document ((collection collection) document &key (shard naive-impl:%loading-shard%) (handle-duplicates-p t) (replace-existing-p t) &allow-other-keys)

Adds a document to the collection, it DOES NOT PERSIST the change, if
you want adding with persistance use persist-document or persist the
collection as a whole after you have done your adding.

add-document returns multiple values:

The first returned value is the actual document supplied.  The second
returned value indicates what action was taken ie. was it added newly
or was an exiting document replaced.  The third returned value is the
replaced document.

NOTES:

In general you should not be calling add-document directly, you should
use persist-document. Calling add-document directly is allowed so you
can create temporary collections that can be thrown away.

cl-naive-store does not have a update-document function, add-document
does both and its behaviour can be complex depending on the key
parameters supplied. Also the behaviour can differ for different types
of collections. Check the appropriate collection documentation for
more details.

Supplying a shard saves the function from trying to figure out which
shard to add the document to. During loading of a shard
naive-impl:%loading-shard% must be used as the default.

add-document ((collection collection) document &key (shard naive-impl:%loading-shard%) (handle-duplicates-p t) (replace-existing-p t) &allow-other-keys)

None of the following will have an effect if handle-duplicates = nil.

If a document with the same keys exists in the collection the supplied
the existing document will be replaced with the supplied document.

If you set replace-existing-p to nil then an existing document wont be
replaced by the supplied document. Basically nothing will be done.

Supplying a shard saves the function from trying to figure out which
shard to add the document to. During loading of a shard
naive-impl:%loading-shard% is used.

**** [generic function] persist-document (collection document-form &key shard &allow-other-keys)

persist-document ((collection collection) document &key shard (handle-duplicates-p t) delete-p &allow-other-keys)

Traverses the document and composes a list representation that is
written to file. If the document is new it is added to the collection.

The shard the document should belong to can be passed in to save the
function from trying to establish which shard on its own.

-----

*** Query

**** [generic function] naive-reduce (collection &key query function initial-value &allow-other-keys)

naive-reduce ((hash-table hash-table) &key query function initial-value  &allow-other-keys)

naive-reduce ((list list) &key query function initial-value  &allow-other-keys)

Uses query to select data documents from a collection and applies the
function to those documents returning the result.

NOTES:

Does lazy loading.

naive-reduce ((collection collection) &key query function initial-value shards &allow-other-keys)
naive-reduce :before ((collection collection) &key shards &allow-other-keys)

Lazy loading data.

**** [generic function] query-data (collection &key query &allow-other-keys)

query-data :before ((collection collection) &key shards &allow-other-keys)

Does lazy loading

query-data ((collection collection) &key query shards &allow-other-keys)

query-data ((store store) &key collection-name query shards &allow-other-keys)

query-data ((hash-table hash-table) &key query &allow-other-keys)

Returns the data that satisfies the query.

NOTES:

Does lazy loading.

Will only use shards supplied if supplied.

**** [generic function] query-document (collection &key query &allow-other-keys)

query-document :before ((collection collection) &key shards &allow-other-keys)

Does lazy loading.

query-document ((collection collection) &key query shards &allow-other-keys)

query-document ((store store) &key collection-name query &allow-other-keys)

query-document ((list list) &key query &allow-other-keys)

query-document ((hash-table hash-table) &key query &allow-other-keys)

Returns the first last document found, and any others that satisfies
the query

NOTES:

Does lazy loading.

-----

** Naive Indexed

**** [global parameter] *do-partial-indexing*

When this is set to t (which is the default), indexing is done for the
individual elements of the indexes as well.

**** [class] indexed-shard (shard)

***** [accessor] hash-index

Hash table keyed on document uuid for quick retrieval of an document.

***** [accessor] key-value-index

Hash table keyed on document key values for quick retrieval of an document.
Used when doing key value equality comparisons.

**** [class] indexed-collection-mixin

Collection extension to add very basic indexes.

***** [accessor] indexes

List of index combinations. Also indexes members partially if
*do-partial-indexing* is t, for example '((:emp-no :surname gender))
is indexed as (:emp-no :surname :gender), (:emp-no :surname), :emp-no,
:surname and :gender

**** [generic function] make-shard ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) shard-mac)

Extends make-shard to deal with indexed collections.

**** [generic function] get-shard ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) shard-mac &key &allow-other-keys)

Extends get-shard to deal with indexed collections.

**** [generic function] hash (document)

(setf hash) (value document)

Returns the hash identifier for a data document. Data documents need a
hash identifier to work with naive-store-indexed. naive-store-indexed
will edit the document to add a hash identifier when adding documents
to a collection. naive-store-indexed uses a UUID in its default
implementation.

**** [generic function] index-lookup-values  (collection values &key shards &allow-other-keys)

index-lookup-values ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) values
&key (shards (and naive-impl:%loading-shard% (list naive-impl:%loading-shard%)))
&allow-other-keys)

Looks up document in key value hash index. If you are not using
document-types then the order of values matter.

Will use shards to limit the lookup to specific shards.

**** [generic function] index-lookup-hash (collection hash &key shards &allow-other-keys)

index-lookup-hash ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) hash
(shards (and naive-impl:%loading-shard%	(list naive-impl:%loading-shard%)))
&allow-other-keys)

Looks up document in UUID hash index.

**** [generic function] add-index (collection shard document &key &allow-other-keys)

add-index ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) shard document &key key-values &allow-other-keys)

Adds a document to two indexes. The first uses a UUID that will stay
with the document for its life time. The UUID is used when persisting
the document and is never changed once created. This allows us to
change key values without loosing the identify of the original
document.

The second is a key value hash index to be used when looking for
duplicate documents during persist. If you are not using
document-types the order of the keys in the plist matter. To make sure
that you dont muck with the order of values/keys in your plists
initialize all the possible value pairs with nil so that way the order
is set.

A shard must be supplied.

**** [generic function] remove-index (collection shard document &key &allow-other-keys)

remove-index ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) shard document &key &allow-other-keys)

Removes a data document from the UUID and key value indexes.

A shard must be supplied.

**** [generic function] existing-document ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) document &key(shard naive-impl:%loading-shard%)  key-values &allow-other-keys)

**** [generic function] add-document ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) document &key (shard naive-impl:%loading-shard%) (replace-existing-p t) (update-index-p t) &allow-other-keys)

Duplicates are not allowed for indexed collections!

If the document has no hash and a document with the same keys exists
in the collection the supplied document's hash will be set to that of
the existing document. The existing document will then be replaced
with the supplied document. This is done to maintain hash consistency
of the store.

If you set replace-existing-p to nil then an existing document wont be
replaced by the supplied document. Basically nothing will be done.

Indexes will be updated by default, if you want to stop index updates
set update-index-p to nil. Just remember that if the document is
really \"new\" to the collection the indexes will be updated in any
case.

**** [generic function] naive-reduce ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) &key index-values query function initial-value)

Extends naive-reduce to be able to take advantage of indexing. Reduce
is done on values retrieved by the supplier index.

**** [generic function] query-data ((collection indexed-collection-mixin) &key index-values query &allow-other-keys)

Extends query-data to be able to take advantage of indexing. Query is
done on values retrieved by the supplier index.

** Document Types

**** [class] element

A definition of an element of a document.

NOTES:

Elements can reference simple types, a complex document or documents
based on other document-types.

naive-store can be used as a hierarchical database or a flat databases
or a mix.

**** [accessor] name

Name of the element. This should be a KEYWORD if you want data
portability and some internals might expect a keyword.

**** [accessor] type-def

A user defined "thing" that defines the type specifics of an element.

**** [accessor] key-p

A property list of additional element attributes that are not data
type specific.

**** [class] document-type

A class that can be use to represent a complex document.

NOTES:

The default implementation of cl-naive-store is unaware of
document-types when reading and writing documents to and from
file. This was by design, to place as little burden on reading and
writing documents. Depending on the use of naive-store a user could
customize the reading and writing methods of naive-store to use
document-types for validation and file layout specifics.

GUI's like cl-wfx use these to help with generic rendering of user
input screens.

See cl-naive-type-defs:*example-type-defs* for examples of type
definitions to get a feel for the intended use.

**** [accessor] store

The store that this document-type belongs to.

**** [accessor] name

String representing a document-type name.

**** [accessor] element-class

The class that should be used to make element documents.
NOTES:

element-class is declaratively specified here because so that elements
can be dynamicly created when definition type definitions are read
from file. See naive-store-documents for usage examples.

**** [accessor] label

Human readable/formated short description.

**** [accessor] elements

Field definitions that represents a data unit.

**** [class] document-type-collection-mixin

Collection extention to make collection of a specific document-type.

**** [accessor] document-type

The document-type that this collection contains documents of.

**** [generic function] get-document-type (store type-name)

get-document-type ((store document-type-store-mixin) type-name)

Returns a document-type document if found in the store.

**** [generic function] add-document-type (store document-type)

Adds a document-type to a store.

-----

** Document Type Defs

**** [generic function] getx (document (element cl-naive-document-types:element) &key &allow-other-keys)

(setf getx) (value document (element cl-naive-document-types:element)

**** [generic function] getxe (document element type &key &allow-other-keys))

(setf getxe) (value document element type &key &allow-other-keys)

**** [generic function] validate-xe (document element type value &key &allow-other-keys))

** Naive Documents

**** [class] document-collection (indexed-collection-mixin document-type-collection-mixin collection)

Document collection class used to specialize on for cl-naive-documents.

**** [class] document-store (document-type-store-mixin store)

document-store (document-type-store-mixin store)

**** [struct] document
A basic struct that represents a document object. A struct is used
because there is meta data that we want to add to the actual document
values and there is additional functionality like being able to know
what has changed in the values during updates.

store = The store that the document comes from.
collection = The collection that the document comes from.
type-def = The document type specification that describes this document.
hash = The hash/UUID that uniquely identifies this document
elements = The actual key value pairs of the doucument.
changes = Is used to store setf values when using getx the preffered accessor for values.
This helps with comparing of values when persisting.
versions = older key value pairs that represent older versions of the document
deleted-p = indicates that the document was deleted.
persisted-p = indicates that the document has been peristed.

**** [generic function] hash ((document document))

**** [generic function] key-values ((collection document-collection) document &key &allow-other-keys)

**** [generic function] document-values ((document document))

**** [generic function] existing-document ((collection document-collection) document &key key-values &allow-other-keys)

**** [generic function] persist-document ((collection document-collection) document &key allow-key-change-p delete-p &allow-other-keys)

persist-document for document-collection is lenient in what it takes
as a document, it can be of type document or a plist.

**** [generic function] persist-document index-values ((collection document-collection) (values document) &key &allow-other-keys)

**** [generic function] getx ((document document) accessor &key &allow-other-keys)

(setf getx) (value (document document) accessor  &key (change-control-p t) &allow-other-keys)

getx for documents knows about some of the internals of an document
structue so you can get the collection.

Special accessors:

:hash = document-hash

The convention is to append %% to these accessors, for two
reasons. First to show that they are special, accessing meta data not
actual values of document. Second to avoid any name classes with
actual data members.

:collection%% = document-collection
:store%% = document-store or (store collection)
:universe%% = (universe store)
:type%% = type
:elements%% = document-elements
:changes%% = document-changes
:versions%% = document-versions
:deleted-p%% = document-deleted-p

store and universe using getx.

**** [generic function]  digx ((place document) &rest indicators)

(setf digx) (value (place document) &rest indicators)
