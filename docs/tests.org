* Test Options

** Keep the test data store directories

We can set the makefile variable =PRESERVE_TEST_FILES= to =T= or to a
directory pathname (with corresponding shell/makefile escaping of
double quotes).

#+begin_src 
make PRESERVE_TEST_FILES=T                                tests
# or:
make PRESERVE_TEST_FILES=\\\"$HOME/test-data-stores/\\\"  tests
#+end_src

When set to =T=, the test data-store directories are renamed (but kept
in the original directory, which is by default a temporary directory).

When set to a directory pathname, the test data-store directories are
copied to the given directiory (and renamed), the original being
deleted for the next test.
